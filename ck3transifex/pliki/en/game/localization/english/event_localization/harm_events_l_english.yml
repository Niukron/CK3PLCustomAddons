My head stills spins from the blows and adrenaline, the surges of fear and rage and exultation and...\n\nSp-spinning. My head is spinning. My vision blurs, then doubles, and I begin to topple into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('GritType')].\n\n\"Fetch a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRandomBattlefieldMedic')|U], the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] has been struck!\", goes the cry,"
