 fp1_trade_events.0003.desc: "A disorderly horde of bandits, pirates, and other heavily-armed scoundrels has entered [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], led by [raider.GetFirstName]!\n\nAt first, my scouts thought them here to pillage, but an emissary from their [raider.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] claims that they would happily trade instead. Their force is rich in plunder, new and old, and this would give the locals a chance to buy exotic goods from across the world.\n\nThe subtext is clear. Trade under preferable terms and they will depart in peace, or reject their offer and they will take what they wish."
